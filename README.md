Siren is a lightweight, small audio tool for unity. The plugin originates from another project from school ([Bali Tower Defence Game](https://github.com/squiig/bali-tower-defense-game)) 

The bali project had 5 developers and 4 artist working on the project from start to finish. Due to the huge size of the team from the start, an audio tool was necessary to integrate, swap and remove audio. This is the result. 
More information about Siren can be found on [my portfolio](http://jaronkuijper.nl/siren).

## FUTURE PLANS

 - Add better support for audio channel configuration (falloff curve is not configurable through script)
 - ADSR Support
 - Precalculated Rects in EditorWindow (Layout Performance)
