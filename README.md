Siren is a lightweight, small audio tool for unity made to easily interchange, adjust and organize audio during editor-runtime. The tool is made with ease of use in mind, so only do developers have to do minimal effort to implement audio inside of the game, designers and even artists easily know how to use it as well. Making it user friendly for the whole game dev family!

For now, more information can be found [here!](http://jaronkuijper.nl/siren/)

## FUTURE PLANS

 - [ ] Add better support for audio channel configuration (falloff curve is not configurable through script)
 - [ ] ADSR Support
 - [ ] Precalculated Rects in EditorWindow (Layout Performance)
